# Sir Trevor JS block generator

## Built by Chris Hutchinson, 2015

A simple programmatic block builder for [Sir Trevor JS](http://www.github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-js).


## Installation

Install via Bower by running:
    
    bower install sir-trevor-generator --save

Include `block.js` into your project to be able to create blocks using this library.

Install via `npm` by running:
    
    npm install sir-trevor-generator --save

This library supports the require syntax in CommonJS: `var SirTrevorBlock = require('sir-trevor-generator');`


### Currently supported fields

- Text
- Textarea
- Number 
- Files
- Select
- Tables (uses [Handsontable](http://handsontable.com/))
- Checkboxes
- Repeaters


### Callbacks

Most fields also support custom callbacks such as the following:
- On paste
- On click
- On keyup

You can define your own callback functions to allow these fields to interact with Sir Trevor JS.

**Callbacks are experimental at the moment, and haven't been tested thoroughly**


### Examples

See the `/examples` folder for a range of example blocks.
